## Installation

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. For usage and installation instructions, visit their website. To integrate OneEntry into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'OneEntry'
```

#### dyld[]: missing symbol called

If you have this error as a result of installing Sdk, via CocoaPods, add the following code to your Podfile

```ruby
post_install do |installer|
  installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
    target.build_configurations.each do |config|
      config.build_settings['BUILD_LIBRARY_FOR_DISTRIBUTION'] = 'YES'
    end
  end
end

target 'OneEntrySDKTest' do
  # Comment the next line if you don't want to use dynamic frameworks
  use_frameworks!
  # Pods for OneEntrySDKTest
  pod 'OneEntry'
end
```

### Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://www.swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the swift compiler.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding OneEntry as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the dependencies value of your Package.swift.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/OneEntry/oneentry-ios-sdk", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.1.0"))
]
```
